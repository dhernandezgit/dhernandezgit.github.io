## Hello World
This is my first entry for the blog! On this blog I'll be talking about the different purposed exercises on the [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/) platform.
For this blog I'm using Jekyll Now combined with Github pages. To easily setup your own blog on Github pages  head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
