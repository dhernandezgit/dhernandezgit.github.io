This is my first entry for the blog! On this blog I'll be talking about the different purposed exercises on the [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/) platform. The first one is the line follower explained after this intro.

## Blog configuration
For this blog I'll be using Jekyll Now combined with Github pages. To easily setup your own blog on Github pages  head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

## Problem statement
The follow line project consists in... Exactly that. With a F1 car. Fast. But keep calm, this will be comfortably done on a web platform with a simulated car capable of taking images with a camera on its front.

Image car + Camera

The control is directly focused on the basic movements, speed and angular speed. No more steering wheels, gears or pedals, with only two controllable actuators the control is simplified to what really matters. The goal is to keep the car as close as possible to the line while completing the full lap. And then... make it faster without crashing on the attempt.
